### Description

This project is about to find a way to specific location in an Unknown Map. As You know, this is the subject of some robotic games and champions. The map is given in a standard graphic file formats like Bitmaps. Then the program uses a recursive algorithms in the given map to find a way to the destination. The destination is specifies by a BLUE color in the map. Due to the recursive algorithms that is used, if the program can't find the destination, it returns to the starting location. I've include 5 sample maps with the project to better introduce its work. Use coloring like samples (Walls=Black , Way=White , Destination=Blue rgb(0,0,255)) and set the starting point anywhere in the way. In sample maps you don't need to set starting point.
